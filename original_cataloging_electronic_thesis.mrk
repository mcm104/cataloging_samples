=520  3\$aUnderstanding the life histories of exploited aquatic taxa is important to sustainable fisheries management. Life history diversity has been shown to stabilize population dynamics through 'portfolio effects' which can maintain robust fishery yields despite environmental variability. Moreover, the reproductive life histories of fishes can be important to shaping management-relevant properties such as the steepness of the stock-recruit relationship, genetic diversity, age and size structure, and stock rebuilding potential. Despite the importance of life history information to conservation and management, achieving a practical understanding of the evolutionary and ecological factors that maintain particular life histories can be challenging. This difficulty is exemplified by widespread declines in size-and-age-at-maturity of many commercially valuable fish stocks, the causes of which are seldom be reliably discerned. In this dissertation, I seek to better understand the factors that control the frequencies of alternative maturation and reproductive life histories in sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) populations. In chapter 1, I used Bayesian hierarchical modelling to identify the basis of variation in early maturation rates among sockeye salmon populations in Bristol Bay, Alaska. In my second chapter, I developed an age-structured Bayesian state space model to assess the causes of elevated early maturation rates in Kodiak sockeye salmon. Finally, in my third chapter I developed an individual-based population dynamics framework to explore the ecological and evolutionary factors that regulate frequencies of alternative maturation and reproductive life histories in age-structured populations. Collectively, my results demonstrate that the maintenance of alternative life histories within populations may be more complex than existing evolutionary frameworks suggest, and reveal a novel role of population dynamics in the evolution and maintenance of complex mating systems.

=520  3\$aManagement of commercial fisheries is imperative to global food security, economies, and sustainability. However, common management frameworks are often challenged when species with differing sustainable exploitation rates are caught simultaneously in a mixed stock fishery. The tradeoffs which emerge are often magnified when overfished stocks are persistent in the system. As observed in the U.S. West Coast groundfish fishery, the priority to rebuild overfished stocks according to a strict timeline can result in forgone yield of abundant species and negative impacts on communities. In this thesis, I retrospectively analyzed alternative rebuilding scenarios for the West Coast to test if a management approach based on meeting fishing mortality targets could result in fewer tradeoffs for stakeholders while still meeting conservation objectives. I then developed a two-area single species age structure model to evaluate if marine closures can be used as an alternative management approach to single-species catch limits and provide adequate rebuilding protection while minimizing forgone yield of abundant stocks. The analyses on alternative management approaches described in this thesis can be applied to global fishery managers as they address similar challenges in their respective fisheries.

=520  3\$aForest management planning aims at selecting the set of stands that should receive treatments such as harvest (harvest scheduling) in different time periods to provide economic, environmental, social, etc., services. However, since forest planning spans several decades, it is subject to many uncertainties including forest growth uncertainty due to climate change. Climate change is of paramount interest because it is arguably one of the most important challenges that contemporary forest managers need to address. It is reported to heavily affect forest growth. Failure to incorporate growth uncertainty in forest management planning can be detrimental to natural resources sustainability since forest managers might implement policies that are not optimal to different climate scenarios. In this dissertation, I argue that climate change uncertainty needs to be explicitly addressed while developing strategic harvest plans. I propose to model forest harvest scheduling in the face of forest growth uncertainty due to climate change as a stochastic optimization problem. This modeling framework allows to make robust decisions without knowing the actual forest growth and yield. However, the resulting optimization models belong to the family of mathematical models deemed hard to solve especially when a high number of scenarios (future growth possibilities) is considered. Moreover, one may argue that the added value of stochastic harvest scheduling models may not be warranted given how their development and implementation is more involved compared to a deterministic model which ignores uncertainties. This research proposes to study how the uncertainty in forest growth due to climate change can be incorporated in forest harvest scheduling. Specifically, in this research 1) I showed that overlooking climate change in harvest scheduling models affects the net present value and the conservation of natural resources; 2) I demonstrated that out of the four climate paths that may affect forest growth in the Pacific northwest, only two climate paths significantly affect the strategic forest harvest scheduling; and 3) I developed a heuristic that allows to handle large size stochastic optimization problems such as the ones in the case of harvest scheduling with climate uncertainty.

=520  3\$aBark beetle outbreaks are major natural disturbances in temperate forests across the northern hemisphere, contributing to extensive tree mortality and driving forest change. Recent widespread and severe outbreaks--and projected climate-driven changes to disturbance activity--have raised concerns about forest resilience and the interaction of future outbreaks with other disturbances (e.g., fire). Thinning (i.e., density reduction) treatments may promote resilience to bark beetles by fostering resistance or bolstering forest capacity to respond post outbreak, but opportunities to test treatment efficacy and longevity have been rare. Further, forest managers must consider the effects of thinning on additional objectives such as tradeoffs between fire hazard mitigation and carbon storage. Here, I used a replicated study of old-growth lodgepole pine stands thinned in 1940 and affected by a recent (early 2000s) severe mountain pine beetle outbreak to examine the effects of thinning on (1) components of resilience to outbreak, and (2) post-outbreak fire hazard and carbon storage. I measured stand structural attributes in the field ~8 years post-outbreak and compared resistance to beetle attack (tree- and stand-scale survival), successional trajectories, fuel profiles, and aboveground carbon biomass between uncut (control) and thinned treatment units. Thinning six decades prior to mountain pine beetle outbreak had limited effects on resistance, but additional effects of thinning on stand trajectories, surface and canopy fuel profiles, and aboveground carbon storage persisted following severe outbreak. This study broadens the temporal extent of our understanding of thinning effects on directing forest response to bark beetle outbreaks, with important implications for developing effective management decisions in the face of global change.

=520  3\$aIn an age where humans are spending an unprecedented portion of their time indoors, disconnected from nature and unaware of the ecosystem that surrounds them, research is beginning to unveil the intricate role of nature in human health. Not only does humanity rely on the natural world for food, water, and other ecosystem services, but also for psychological well-being, happiness, and mental health maintenance. Many individuals anecdotally understand that time spent in natural settings can ease negative mental health issues such as stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms, while encouraging positive psychological states, such as happiness and relaxation. Epidemiologists, ecologists, neuroscientists, and researchers from many other disciplines are digging deeply into these ideas, transforming anecdotes into scientific research, and uncovering the mechanisms underlying the connection between mental health and natural environments. They are also exploring whether and to what extent existing trends between greenspace exposure and benefits to mental health may differ among different populations and individuals. To build upon this body of work and help fill critical research gaps, I conducted two research projects-- an environmental epidemiological analysis of data from a large-scale health cohort and a narrative literature review on the Japanese health practice of forest-bathing. The first project utilized data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), an epidemiologic cohort study with 6,814 participants from six sites across the US. In this analysis, I tested for association between residential proximity to greenspace, measured by the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and scores from the Center for Epidemiologic Studies (CES) Depression Scale, a measure of depressive symptoms. To determine the role of individual-level characteristics in modifying this relationship, I assessed the degree to which chronic burden, a proxy for chronic stress, modified the effects of greenspace on depressive symptoms. This allowed me to determine if highly burdened individuals have pronounced mental health benefits associated with exposure to greenspace. The second project was a narrative literature review on the mental health and psychological well-being benefits of forest exposure. This review builds upon the forest-bathing literature by exploring potential biological and psychological mechanisms underlying the association between forest terpene exposure and benefits to human health. Together, these two projects contribute to the growing body of nature and health literature by diving deeper into mechanistic pathways and by determining the role of individual-level characteristics in the effect of nature on mental health and well-being.

=520  3\$aIn the United States, there are more than 330 million acres of row crop agricultural land that produce an abundant supply of food and other products to support food security and economic development. Meanwhile, agricultural nonpoint source (NPS) pollution, most generally occurring in the absence of a landscape conservation plan, is the leading cause of water quality impairments in the rivers and streams in the United States. Voluntary incentive programs are the primary policy mechanism to improve the water quality of agricultural landscapes, employed to increase the supply of non-market ecosystem services alongside food and energy provision. This project seeks to improve the cost-effectiveness of the incentive designs by paying careful attention to both biophysical and farmers' socio-economic factors. Specifically, I 1).developed a hybrid optimization paradigm that combined the evolutionary algorithms with weighted benefit-to-cost ratio ranking to tackle the problem of spatial interdependence in multi-objective optimization; 2).identified the underlying socio-psychological drivers of farmers' intentions for conservation practices adoption, based on first-hand agricultural landowner survey data, factor analysis, and cluster analysis; and 3).estimated landowners' Willingness-to-Accept to the incentive payments and characterized their preference heterogeneity by discrete choice experiments and mixed logit modeling. The project's results enable us to identify the spatially explicit cost-efficient conservation portfolios and analyze trade-offs/synergies among water conservation objectives under various management scenarios. Meanwhile, it advances the designs of targeted incentive mechanisms corresponding to landowners' preferences. My research integrated interdisciplinary knowledge and techniques to explore the complex natural-human system within the Minnesota River Basin for cost-efficient conservation incentive designs. The modeling framework is also transferable to other agricultural landscapes across the nation.

=520  3\$aApex predators can influence ecosystems by changing the density and behavior of herbivores and other predators. As an ecosystem superpredator, humans may also shape top-down effects in ecological communities by altering apex predator abundance and behavior. In many parts of the world, apex predators live in, or are returning to, landscapes that are human dominated. Thus, it is important to understand the ecological role of apex predators in anthropogenic, multi-use landscapes. I used motion-activated camera traps set in a multi-use landscape in northeastern Washington to compare the effects of: 1) wolves (Canis lupus) on spatiotemporal activity patterns of mesopredators and sympatric apex predators; and 2) the effects of hunting and apex predators on the spatiotemporal activity of herbivorous prey. In areas with wolves, other predators used temporal niche partitioning to avoid wolves. Cougars (Puma concolor) and coyotes (Canis latrans) became more active during the daytime, when wolves were least active, which significantly increased their activity overlap with humans. By contrast, bobcats (Lynx rufus) exposed to wolves changed their activity in patterns opposite to coyotes at nighttime and dusk. Although both mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) increased nocturnality significantly during hunting seasons, the deer species showed species-specific spatiotemporal responses to hunting that, in the case of mule deer, deviated from their typical anti-predator behavior. This pushed mule deer, but not white-tailed deer, into greater spatiotemporal overlap with wolves during hunting seasons, and thus may lead to additive mortality on mule deer from increased wolf predation. In conclusion, the top-down effects of wolves on the behavior of their intraguild competitors appear to be resilient to human disturbance in this system. However, effects on their herbivore prey may be overwhelmed by humans during hunting seasons, leading to greater spatiotemporal overlap with predators. More broadly, my findings highlight that temporal behavioral plasticity is an underappreciated aspect of animal behavior that helps animals manage risk and reduce the negative effects of competition. In addition, the top-down effects of apex predators appear to persist in human-dominated landscapes, particularly within the carnivore guild.

=520  3\$aCoastal zones are one of the most dynamic natural ecosystems of our planet. The survival and livelihoods of coastal communities are contingent on the ecosystem services that coastal zones provide. Primary among these services is the reduction of coastal risks through the attenuation/ dissipation of wave energy, breaking of offshore waves, slowing of inland water transfer and sediment stabilization. These functions protect people and infrastructure from coastal risks like tsunamis, storm surges, high wind and wave velocity, and other such extreme events. There is increasing evidence that coastal ecosystems including marshes, mangroves, near-shore coral reefs, seagrass beds, and sandy beaches and dunes provide the critical service of coastal risk reduction. Coastal systems and low-lying areas will increasingly experience adverse impacts brought on by climate change such as submergence, coastal flooding, and coastal erosion due to relative sea-level rise. Changes in storm intensity, high wind and wave velocity and storm surges may further contribute to an increase in the hazards faced by coastal communities. My analysis showed that the threats faced by the states on the eastern coast of India are very high and the coping capacity of these states is low. This would exacerbate the impact of extreme events, brought on by climate change, in these states. Further, geospatial analysis shows that natural coastal ecosystems have declined over the last two decades and urbanization has occurred at a very fast pace, at the expense of these natural ecosystems. Coastal population has also increased, further increasing the exposure to coastal risks. Using DPSIR as a framework, I analyzed two polices relevant to coastal risk reduction and climate change, the National Action Plan on Climate Change (2008) and the Coastal Regulation Zone (2019). My analysis showed that these policies do not sufficiently identify and address the climate drivers and the pressures that coastal ecosystems face. They also do not fully identify the state of the ecosystem or address the pressures. The response needs augmenting as zoning allows for too many exemptions and permissions, identification and mapping of important areas of concern have not been completely carried out, and clear goals have not been set. The measures do not adequately address threats and do not contain objective criteria for assessment. Further, outcome indicators have also not been defined. While data illustrates the fact that coastal risks have increased due to urbanization and loss of natural cover, sufficient measures have not been put in place to address these. Based on the shortcomings and lacunae in the capacity of the analyzed policies to address threats to coastal areas, I have proposed a number of modifications in these policies. Most of these recommendations relate to the inclusion of an ecosystem perspective in these policies. There is also a need to take a science based approach to policy making which would make these policies more responsive to the increasing threats to coastal risk reduction in the light of climate change. Inclusion of measures to address climate drivers, pressures, impacts and threats would better position these policies in conserving the coastal ecosystems and enhance their capacity for risk reduction.

=520  3\$aThis thesis investigates environmental nongovernmental organizations (ENGOs) operating in the non-Western setting of the Republic of South Korea by presenting a literature review of the history of Korean NGOs and the environmental movement in Korea, and analyzing data gathered while conducting interviews at a selection of Korean ENGOs. By adapting the Family Health International (FHI) 360 Civil Society Organization Sustainability Index (CSOSI), this study advances the field of research on the Korean civil society sector by offering insights into how Korean ENGOs have adapted to changes and sustained themselves as organizations. It examines Korean ENGOs' autonomy from the Korean government, the impact of government funding on ENGOs advocacy, and ENGOs' concern about how they are perceived by other sectors in Korea. The findings reveal three hypotheses for further research on the ENGO sector in Korea and other parts of the world.

=520  3\$aThis thesis outlines historic trends and current policy focus toward privatization in the ocean, provides a basis for assessing how this process is affecting access to fisheries resources, and suggests how considerations of equity should be incorporated into our assessments of such changing access regimes. The current focus on privatization as a means for extracting the most economic benefit from the ocean endangers access to resources that are important for food and livelihood security for a large percentage of the global population. Ultimately, in order to preserve equitable access to fisheries resources and food production in the coastal landscape, we need to develop a system or typology that carefully documents existing access rights and fisheries management regimes, whether reforms are deemed successful, and what their sustainability outcomes are. This documentation is important not only so changes can be measured over time and so we can consider alternatives, but so the voices of those who may be marginalized by large-scale transitions in access can be considered. This thesis provides a brief overview of the history of enclosure of the Commons, drawing parallels between land and sea, before focusing more directly on saving space for food production in the ocean. Next, the access arrangements, governance and management models that are in common use for regulating access to fisheries are introduced before considering how the analysis of fisheries management and governance styles have been approached in the past. Finally, a typology of access arrangements is proposed.

=520  3\$aThe Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) was the first carbon cap-and-trade policy established in the U.S. The goal of RGGI was to mitigate climate change by regulating the emission of CO₂ from fossil-fuel fired electric power plants located in the ten participating Northeast states. Given CO₂ disperses globally, any reduction in emissions regardless of geographic location is beneficial in reducing the impacts of climate change, making CO₂ an ideal pollutant for flexible market-based instruments. However, since CO₂ emissions from fossil-fuel fired power plants are accompanied with co-pollutants that cause local harm to human health, market-based solutions create the potential for co-pollutant hotspots to form. This analysis examined whether RGGI has resulted in hotspots in locations where they could disproportionately impact communities color, low-income, low-educational attainment, and linguistic isolation. Temporal trends in emission of CO₂ with respect to multiple measures of neighborhood demographics were evaluated using data from 2000 - 2019. The results of this research found that (1) neighborhoods near facilities regulated under RGGI have higher proportions of non-white residents, low educational attainment, poverty, and linguistic isolation than those further away; (2) twenty nine percent of facilities have continued to increase their emissions since the implementation of RGGI; and (3) the neighborhoods located near facilities with increasing emissions are found to have a statistically significant higher proportion of residents of color and households below the poverty line. These results raise environmental equity concerns regarding the health of communities of color and low-income located in RGGI states.

Metabolites are the currency of microbial metabolism, are carefully regulated to meet the metabolic demands of organisms living in dynamic environments, and reflect cellular status and metabolic strategies for nutrient acquisition, energy storage, redox maintenance, and more. This dissertation focuses on developing metabolomics techniques for the marine environment and using them to study microbial dynamics over time and space to identify compounds that are key microbial currencies. In order to study natural populations of marine microbes, I developed a method for targeted and untargeted metabolomics data acquisition and analysis with the unique challenges of marine samples in mind (Chapter 2). I use this method to study the influence of the diel cycle on the marine microbial community at Station ALOHA in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre, ultimately showing synchrony of daytime anabolism and nighttime catabolism as seen through diel oscillations of ubiquitous metabolites including cofactors and vitamins. Through pairing metabolite and gene expression data, I demonstrate the strategies that specific photoautotrophs use to manage the daily fluctuations in solar energy (Chapter 3). To examine how microorganisms respond to other environmental forcings, I investigate the metabolism of microbial communities across the North Pacific Transition Zone and identify metabolic currencies used by those communities to adapt to varying nutrient supply (Chapter 4). Nutrient amendment experiments show the dominance of nitrogen limitation throughout this region and the potential for iron-nitrogen co-limitation near the subtropical chlorophyll front. Finally, in order to explore the potential for metabolites to be nutrient sources to the microbial community, I investigate the ability of natural microbial communities to use the abundant osmolyte glycine betaine. I determine the kinetics of uptake and identify the metabolic uses of glycine betaine in two different natural microbial communities and show that its use as a nutrient differs depending on DIN availability (Chapter 5). In full, this dissertation provides some of the first metabolomics measurements in the natural marine environment and identifies and explores the roles of key organic molecules in shaping the microbial community structure and function.

=520  3\$aEarth's climate and biology mediate the availability of dissolved oxygen (O₂) in seawater, a key environmental constraint on energy acquisition for diverse marine life. Energy available for organismal growth, activity, and maintenance becomes limited when the environmental O₂ supply falls short of the biological demand, a physiological condition termed 'hypoxia', which has far-reaching biogeochemical and ecological consequences beyond fitness detriments to individual species. For instance, in the ocean's small anoxic zones (O₂ < ~5 muM), O₂ limitation of aerobic microbes selects for slower anaerobic metabolisms that convert nitrate (NO₃-), a critical macronutrient, to biologically inert N2 gas, thereby causing widespread nitrogen limitation of phytoplankton. Marine animals are more sensitive to low O₂ conditions than microbes and have no sustainable alternative metabolism to aerobic energy production. Even modest O₂ depletion can thus lead to their habitat restriction, both in the long-term by stable aerobic barriers, and dynamically from climate forcing. On geologic timescales, periods of extreme ocean warming and O₂ loss have been tied to episodes of global mass extinction. Currently, anthropogenic climate warming risks O₂ depletion of the modern ocean, threatening both global marine productivity and biodiversity. In this thesis, I aim to use mathematical models of physiology, ecology, biogeochemistry, and climate to explore the effects of hypoxia on marine ecosystems. In Chapters 2 and 3, I develop and analyze a microbial ecosystem model of the ocean's low O₂ zones, fit to geochemical data, to study how competitive dynamics between aerobic and anaerobic microbes regulate global nutrient loss. I find that species competition along minute O₂ gradients at the edges of anoxic zones modulates the long-term rate of ocean N removal, its sensitivity to climate forcing, and causes basin-wide fluctuations in N loss over time even in a stable environment. In Chapters 4 and 5, I focus on marine animal extinction risks from O₂ loss driven by warming by combining Earth System Model simulations of past and future climate change events with a model of species' ecophysiologial limits, calibrated by published laboratory measurements. Focusing on the Permian/Triassic marine mass extinction (~252 million years ago), in Chapter 4, I find that the predicted intensity and biogeographic signature of extinctions arising from ocean warming and O₂ loss explain reconstructions of this event from the marine fossil record. This work thus establishes a mechanistic link between global warming, hypoxia and extinction, with dire implications for future climate change. In Chapter 5, I project animal extinction risks from anthropogenic climate warming and O₂ loss under divergent future greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. If future emissions continue to accelerate, by the end of the century, extinctions driven by temperature-dependent hypoxia will surpass those from current anthropogenic threats, eventually risking a mass extinction comparable to the "Big Five" biotic crises in Earth's past. "Flattening the curve" of global greenhouse gas emissions would curtail these extinction risks, protecting the diversity of animal life in the oceans.

=520  3\$aOver the past decade marine heatwaves (MHWs) have gained increased attention due to their long-lasting impacts on marine ecosystems and the services they provide. These unusual, warm-water events have occurred throughout the global ocean, often having the most severe impacts along the coast. As ocean temperatures continue to rise due to anthropogenic greenhouse gas forcing, MHWs are expected to become more frequent, intense, and longer-lasting. This raises concerns for how dangerous MHWs may become in the future. This dissertation provides new insights into the spatiotemporal evolution of marine heatwaves using a global network of satellite and in situ observations. This work first describes the role of the ocean and atmosphere in driving upper ocean temperature seasonally using a mixed layer heat budget, which is essential to diagnosing the drivers of MHWs. The roles of subsurface temperature, salinity, and density are also examined with respect to the persistence and penetration of recent Northeast Pacific MHWs. Lastly, a new tracking algorithm is proposed to characterize the spatiotemporal evolution of MHWs globally, and to understand the sensitivities of spatial resolution and chosen thresholds in the detection of MHWs. This collection of work contributes to the eventual forecast of MHWs that will assist marine managers in mitigating the harmful impacts from these events in the future.

=520  3\$aModern coral reef ecosystems house 25% of the planet's entire marine biodiversity in ~ 0.1% of the surface area cover of the ocean and provide numerous ecosystem services for human populations. Unfortunately, these marine rainforests are known to be in a global state of decline, largely due to the impacts of sea-surface warming, ocean acidification, pollution, disease, and other direct human impacts. Numerous studies have proposed that as these stressors increase in reef environments, a pronounced shift from precipitation to dissolution of calcium carbonate (CaCO₃) substrates will induce the collapse of habitat-forming coral structures and lead to dominance of macroalgae. Together, these changes lend themselves to a decline in the overall biodiversity of marine organisms hosted in today's reef ecosystems in addition to major losses to global fisheries,erosion of coastal protection, and dissolution of the foundations of many tropical islands. As a means to improve future reef management and adaptation strategies, there has been a recent push for the development of new tools for monitoring the health of coral reefs under environmental stressors. My research follows a forensic geochemistry approach to understand ecological shifts within and between reef ecosystems in the age of anthropogenic climate change. Specifically, I combine discrete and continuous measurements of seawater composition in coral reef environments, mathematical modeling, and high-resolution mass spectrometry to determine the most effective geochemical proxies for changes in reef metabolism and community composition under stress. Here, I will report on (1) the limitations of exploring variability in modern reef metabolism through assumptions of canonical relationships between carbon and oxygen budgets, (2) the development of a high-precision method for detecting variability in the seawater dissolved strontium-to-calcium (Sr/Casw) ratio and its potential as an indicator of calcifier community composition, and (3) variability in the stable carbon isotope (delta-13 C) composition of seawater dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) on reefs as a potential proxy for benthic primary producer community composition. With the current unprecedented decline of coral reef ecosystems, the ultimate goal of my research is to construct a sophisticated and quantitative toolkit for detecting ecological transitions within these dynamic marine habitats.

=520  3\$aGauging the magnitude of model uncertainty and incorporating model uncertainty into predictions is of critical importance when models are used to inform wildfire-related decisions, where ignoring potential risks threaten human health, property, and the environment. Although techniques exist for addressing model uncertainty, these uncertainties are commonly ignored in most analyses. In this dissertation, I will evaluate the effects of model uncertainty on statistical predictions of wildfire activity in multiple contexts and propose techniques to incorporate these uncertainties into predictions. I will determine how uncertainty in the choice of predictive model and climate model influence forecasts of very-large fire activity in the second half of the 21st century, and integrate this uncertainty using a novel Bayesian model averaging approach to produce robust predictions. I find that when these model uncertainties are accounted for, that one may conclude, across the suite of model choices, that the frequency of very-large wildfires should be expected to increase in most regions of the United States if climate changes are not mitigated. The effects of model uncertainty will also be explored in the context of predicting final wildfire size for individual fires that have no yet finished growing. Specifically, I will gauge how the choice of utility function and the inclusion of growth information that is unavailable early in the wildfire's life alters the predictive ability of statistical models of final fire size and the stability of the model structure. I find that predictions of fire size can drastically change when new utility functions are considered, particularly in models that use growth information. I also find that the covariates used in the best model are sensitive to the choice of utility function, and that no single model is likely to optimally address the preferences of all wildfire-related decisionmakers they are intended to inform. The results of this analysis that (1) the preferred model will often change when new performance measures are considered, and (2) that the preferred model may change over time. I also present a method of integrating the model uncertainties associated with time-varying covariates and ill-defined utility functions into a single predictive distribution using Bayesian model averaging. I find that this novel model averaging approach generally improves predictive performance across a number of performance measures compared to the individual models contained within it. I discuss how the novel methods developed can be applicable to other forecasting applications and how they might allow wildfire professionals make better decisions.

=520  3\$aPopulation collapse in forage fish occurs both naturally and due to overfishing, and is a challenge to sustainable fisheries management. Sustained low abundance can result in prolonged fishery closures and impact the abundance of other species via predation or competition. The time taken to recover from collapse is determined by uncertain factors that control population dynamics and can widely vary between populations. Herring (Clupea spp.) are a major group of forage fishes with numerous populations throughout the Northern Hemisphere, that have sustained commercial fisheries for centuries and indigenous fishers for far longer, and support ecologically and economically valuable species including various pinnipeds, whales, seabirds, and predatory fishes. Herring populations across the world have shown varying durations of population collapse since the start of industrial fishing while hypotheses of the underlying factors have been underdetermined across and within individual populations. The Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii) population in Prince William Sound, Alaska is a modern enduring example of prolonged population collapse whose population dynamics remain largely uncertain and unpredictable despite intensive monitoring and modeling. In this dissertation, I explore and evaluate factors that potentially influence population collapse and recovery within herring. My overarching goal is to better inform the population dynamics of herring and more specifically improve the Bayesian stock assessment model of Prince William Sound herring. In Chapter 1, I conducted a meta-analysis on time series collected for 64 populations worldwide to statistically characterize population collapse and recovery in herring and model predictors of recovery times in adult biomass and recruitment. After collapse, herring populations recovered in 11 years on average, with a few populations remaining collapsed for multiple decades. Amongst populations, recovery time duration did not coincide with fishery closures, which occurred at low abundance in most Pacific herring populations but no Atlantic herring populations. Faster recovery in biomass was best associated with higher average recruitment and higher oceanographic variability in both sea surface height anomalies and sea surface temperatures. In Chapter 2, I modeled ecological factors impacting natural mortality and recruitment in Prince William Sound herring using a custom-built Bayesian age-structured stock assessment model. Support for individual factors was evaluated using multiple Bayesian model selection criteria and alternative modeling assumptions about the ecological data representing these factors. There was strongest evidence for effects on herring natural mortality from pink salmon abundance in Prince William Sound had the most broad and consistent support. Statistical support differed by the type of selection criteria, model assumptions regarding covariates, and time period modeled, resulting in generally weak evidence for most individual effects and the suggestion that results are sensitive to model flexibility. In Chapter 3, I developed a novel modeling framework and conducted a simulation study to test the usefulness of age-specific antibody, or seroprevalence, data in assessing the impact of disease-associated mortality on herring, for use in stock assessment models. Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) in Prince William Sound herring is used as a case study due to its association with fish kills and well-established ecological principles for its epizootiology from extensive monitoring of VHSV in herring populations. I found that incorporating seroprevalence data within stock assessment can accurately inform infection history and disease mortality and improve population estimates. The first real application of age-specific VHSV seroprevalence is demonstrated with the Prince William Sound herring stock assessment. While motivated from VHSV in herring, these models can be easily adapted to different host populations and pathogens and I present advice for future applications of disease data within stock assessment.

=520  3\$aA mobile dual-frequency identification sonar (DIDSON) was used as an alternate technology to characterize diel juvenile Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp) distributions along an armored and eco-engineered marine shoreline. Eco-engineering modifications to seawall habitat were intended to create an intertidal corridor for shore-oriented salmon and included the addition of marine mattresses (mesh bags filled with rocks) to create intertidal benches, a textured seawall to increase invertebrate colonization, and embedded glass blocks in an overhanging sidewalk to increase ambient light. Acoustic surveys conducted April to August 2019 along the Seattle, Washington, waterfront were used to compare acoustic and snorkel sampling methods and to quantify diel salmon habitat preferences. Acoustic salmon counts were at least twice as high as snorkel counts in most habitats with the difference attributed to the ability of the DIDSON to sample a greater range and volume than visual surveys. Snorkel salmon detections (i.e., salmon counts n ≥ 1) were higher than acoustic detections at new and reference sites, apart from under pier microhabitats, with the difference attributed to the ability of snorkelers to identify lone fish or individuals within mixed groups of fish. Results from generalized linear models and generalized linear mixed models demonstrate that the eco-engineered shoreline creates preferred diel habitat for salmon, while traditional under-pier habitats are less preferred for salmon regardless of time of day. Increased ambient light, fewer shading structures (e.g., pier pilings), and shallow water improve nearshore habitats for juvenile salmon. Pier end salmon counts exceeded under-pier counts and were similar to between pier counts, indicating that some salmon prefer to navigate around pier ends rather than under them. Overall salmon presence was two times higher at night compared to during the day. Salmon presence in the intertidal corridor was more similar to reference sites at night than during the day. Highest salmon counts occurred in transects exposed to artificial light, indicating potential influence of light along the Seattle waterfront. The results of night sampling highlight the need for day/night fish sampling to reduce bias in habitat use and abundance estimates, and to identify diel differences in anthropogenic effects on nearshore communities. This study establishes that the DIDSON is a viable nearshore mobile sampling tool for small fishes (25 mm - 90 mm) that increases sampling efficiency and spatiotemporal knowledge of nocturnal fish distributions and habitat use over snorkeling counts.

=520  3\$aFreshwater ecosystems transfer and transform energy, nutrients and carbon. The color of lakes and rivers, as observed from space, can provide clues to their ecological function and response to anthropogenic activities. Despite this, remote sensing science has been slower to mature for freshwaters relative to terrestrial and marine ecosystems. This research pairs physical and biogeochemical measurements collected during field campaigns with airborne and satellite remote sensing to improve our understanding of the links between color and chemistry in lakes and rivers. Using remote sensing, we mapped over 3,000 river miles in order to better understand uncertainties introduced to remote sensing retrievals during atmospheric correction of satellite imagery. Building from this work, we then conducted remote sensing analysis of ~500,000 lakes combined with a subset of intensive field surveys to (1) establish the relationship between color and gross primary productivity in shallow arctic-boreal lakes, (2) quantify multi-decadal trends in lake color across arctic-boreal North America, and (3) evaluate the effect of climate variability on arctic-boreal lake color trends. We found that atmospheric correction can bias model results by 3 - 59% for estimates of chlorophyll-a and turbidity derived from Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 for three large river systems: the Columbia, Amazon and Mississippi. We also discovered the green band (reflectance ~ 560 nm) was the least impacted by uncertainties from processor or sensor choice, implying that the green band is most suitable for historical or cross-sensor analysis. This chapter has been published in Remote Sensing of the Environment. Applying this framework in the high northern latitudes, moderate resolution (30m) satellite and high resolution (5 m) hyperspectral airborne remote sensing imagery were used to infer gross primary productivity rates from arctic-boreal lakes within the NASA Arctic-Boreal Experiment (ABoVE) domain. This study was published in Environmental Research Letters. We then use the Landsat archive to map annual growing season greenness from 1985 - 2019 for lakes throughout the entire ABoVE domain. Over a quarter of lakes showed significant color change. Declining greenness was the dominant trend and was most common in areas also undergoing warming and precipitation increases. This finding, which has been submitted to Proceedings of the National Academy of the Sciences, provides evidence in support of the hypothesis that warming is restructuring arctic-boreal lake ecological dynamics because of changes, in part due to changing hydrologic connectivity. Collectively, these studies have advanced our understanding of the ecological significance of lake and river color, including opportunities to uncover new relationships between lake color and chemistry by combining novel geochemistry data with remote sensing.

=520  3\$aAs a whole, forest ecosystems sequester carbon from the atmosphere and serve as an enormous pool for carbon storage in their soils and vegetation. As climate change accelerates due to the buildup of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in our atmosphere, it is increasingly important to understand how these carbon pools exchange GHGs with the atmosphere and how these gas fluxes are influenced by environmental change. The Hoh Rainforest in the Olympic Peninsula of Washington state is well recognized for its large quantities of epiphytes and canopy soil on tree branches, which can serve as an additional pool of carbon and site for greenhouse gas flux. This study is a first attempt to measure greenhouse gas flux from Hoh Rainforest canopy soils and quantify their contribution to the overall flux by these forest soils. Data collection to develop the sampling protocol showed that emissions of carbon dioxide and methane from canopy soils were not significantly related to distance from the bole or branch height. Here we show that temperate rainforest canopy soils are a source for carbon dioxide emissions and, on average, a sink for atmospheric methane, though flux rates for both gases were slower in canopy soils than those measured on the forest floor soils. After scaling for the surface area of each soil type found in these ecosystems, canopy soils contributed about 4% to overall soil carbon dioxide emissions and 4% to overall soil methane sequestration. While carbon dioxide emission per unit surface area in these canopy soils was comparable to measurements in tropical forest canopy soils, methane sequestration was greater than that seen in other studies. Moisture and temperature did not have a clear influence on GHG flux rates in this study, emphasizing the need for more sampling to understand potential effects of environmental change on these canopy soil systems. By measuring greenhouse gas flux in these smaller carbon pools, we can better understand the nuances of carbon cycling in these forests and how these unique ecosystems may respond to a changing climate.

=520  3\$aCoral reefs are vibrant and important ecosystems in the oceans, but reefs today are under threat from multiple sources. One such threat is ocean acidification due to anthropogenic climate change, which is reducing both seawater pH and the thermodynamic driving force for CaCO₃-based biomineralization (oversaturation or omega). It is known that coral skeletal growth will decrease in an acidifying ocean, but the detailed mechanisms driving this response are still poorly understood. In addition, there is a long-standing debate in the field regarding the relative impact of skeletal organic matrix proteins on calcification and nucleation, with some claiming that these proteins can mitigate the effects of ocean acidification. Nucleation is the first step of the skeleton growing process, and as such is the step that is thought to determine the pace, pattern, and strength of the coral skeleton, and by extension, the development of the very framework that holds reefs together. We made the first quantitative measurements of inorganic aragonite nucleation and its sensitivity to omega, mapping the energy landscape of nucleation kinetics, and finding that it is more sensitive to oversaturation than bulk mineral growth rates in the environmentally relevant range of omega values. Furthermore, we combined inorganic mineral growth rates from the literature with the nucleation rates measured in this work in a numerical model to make predictions about how these two processes work together to affect the overall skeleton. In order to determine the extent of biological control over nucleation, we measured the quantitative effects of a peptide from the acidic domain of a matrix protein from Stylophora pistillata, as well as matrix protein analogues and polypeptides with different functional groups, on nucleation rates and other growth properties. We found that although the matrix protein and analogues had an effect on nucleation, it is unlikely that this protein can counteract the effects of ocean acidification. Overall, this work provides a comprehensive look at inorganic aragonite nucleation and the balance of chemical and biological controls on inorganic rates, as well as how these inorganic studies pertain to corals. These experiments quantify the limits of corals' ability to respond to the environmental pressure of ocean acidification on skeletal growth.

=520  3\$aThere is growing evidence that time spent in nature can affect well-being. Nonetheless, assessing this relationship can be difficult. We used social media data--1,971,045 geolocated tweets sent by 81,140 users from locations throughout Seattle, Washington, USA--to advance our understanding of the relationship between subjective well-being and natural environments. Specifically, we quantified the relationships between sentiment (negative/neutral/positive) expressed in individual geolocated tweets and their surrounding environments focusing on land-cover type, tree-canopy density, and urban parks. Controlling for multiple covariates such as location types and weather conditions, we estimated three random-intercept partial proportional odds models corresponding to the three environmental indicators. Our results suggest that for a given type of land-use, tweets sent from some natural land-cover types were less likely to be negative compared to tweets sent from the urban-built land-cover type. We also found that for tweets sent in industrial zones, the association between tree-canopy coverage and sentiment polarity was positive: an increase in tree-canopy coverage was associated with a lower probability of having negative sentiments and with a higher probability of having positive sentiments; but for tweets sent in commercial/mixed zones, the association between tree-canopy coverage and sentiment polarity was negative. For parks, tweets sent from urban parks in commercial/mixed zones and residential zones were less likely to be negative compared to tweets sent from outside parks. In industrial zones, only tweets sent from large natural parks (with area >= 40,000 sf2 and impervious surface < 30%) were less likely to be negative. Surprisingly, we also found that tweets sent from large natural parks in residential zones were less likely to be positive compared to tweets sent from outside parks. Geolocated social media data allows nuanced analyses that reveal the complexity of the relationship between subjective well-being and natural environments.

=520  3\$aGrouping (schooling, flocking, herding) is broadly distributed across taxa and environments, and is particularly common in marine fishes. A rich body of theory outlines ways in which grouping can enhance individual fitness, especially by improved predator avoidance and foraging efficiency. However, such theories are difficult to test in the wild, especially in marine environments where observing individuals is challenging, and quantifying predation risk or foraging success is often impossible. To overcome these difficulties, I analyzed a multi-decadal data set from sampling of Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) in the ocean. Across all species, individuals in larger groups had lower risk of predator attack, inferred from wounds on surviving fish. Within groups, outliers (smaller and larger fish) were disproportionately attacked by predators, suggesting that collective predator avoidance resulted from a confusion effect. For slower growing species, individuals in larger groups had lower foraging success, indicating that schooling presented a trade-off between predator avoidance and resource consumption. In contrast, for faster growing species, individuals in larger groups had higher foraging success, indicating that this trade off may not exist and individuals in larger groups may even benefit from collective foraging. These results support long-standing theories on the benefits of group living that have rarely been tested in wild populations, and challenge earlier assertions that adult salmon do not school in the marine environment. Ultimately, these results indicate that survival and growth are group-size dependent and thus understanding the relationship between group-size distributions and population size may be critical to unraveling ecology and population dynamics for these and other marine fishes.
